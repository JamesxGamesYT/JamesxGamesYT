### Hello! :smirk_cat:

My name is Jam Lian and I'm a researcher, coder, mathematician, a land use/politics/catan enjoyer. I'm also a 2023 Atlas fellow. 
Here you will find many of my projects, both for research and personal purposes. 

Mostly Python, but also some HTML/CSS/Javascript, C++, Java. 

Fun personal stuff:
- quotable-quotes-bot: Discord integration with Google Docs to provide quotable quotes interfacing. 
- hte-election-model: Statistical model for the 2020 presidential election. 48/50 states called correctly. 
- midisheet: Leveraging Musescore API to convert midi videos into sheet music. 

Work stuff:
- supply-chain-research: self-explanatory. 
- FtcRobotController: codebase for my robotics team, the Niskayuna RoboWarriors. 
- (https://github.com/hacking-the-election/gerrymandering): Development of gerrymandering detection and redistricting algorithms
- (https://github.com/gcrsef-gang/in-the-zone): Code for analysis of land-use policy and upzoning in NYC.
